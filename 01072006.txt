TIP OF THE  WEEK

   News Search  Changes: While this does not address  the major changes we
   need to make to our news search – those are targeted for  February/March
   – we did make a change to the default search return.  Previously, if you
   searched on a term, we provided results based on relevance.  Now, the
   returns are displayed in date order, with newest date first.

POST/POST.COM  WINS

   Consumer  Electronics Show: This combined effort by The Post’s
   technology writers and washingtonpost.com’s Chet  Rhodesled to this
   specially constructed template that  combines both our inline video
   player, an article archives, an inline blog and  a poll. Obviously, this
   template can be reused.
   The  List:We  worked to make the display more Web-friendly, and also
   added in hyperlinks to  some of the hots and not-hots of 2005.
   The  Best of The Post: The Post’s photo staff and our  multimedia staff
   worked for weeks to put together these galleries of the  newspaper’s
   best photos of the year.



WORTH A  PEEK

   Programmableweb.com:Mashups – the act of combining  databases from
   different sources – is one of the hot Web trends of the day.  Here’s a
   site that lists some many of the interesting mashups that have been
   created.

OTHER NEWS

Competition

   USA Today has announced it will no  longer do Live Discussions in its

   on 1/3.


Awards

   Video journalist Travis Fox has  won the CINE Golden Eagle Award for his
   work with The Post’s Phil Kennicott on  “Making  Space for Democracy,” a
   profile on three countries and their quests for  democracy. You can read
   more on Travis and the terrific work he’s done (much  of it with Phil)

Congressional  Database

   The El Paso Times recently wrote  an article  about the significant
   number of votes missed by its representative, and it  quoted our
   database as the source of the information.
   In its first month,  the database garnered more than a quarter million
   page views, with the number  ramping up even during the slower second
   half of December. The buzz on this  particular project has been
   terrific, and you can see some of the good buzz at
   http://www.technorati.com/search/projects.washingtonpost.com%2Fcongress.
   Yahoo picked the database as one  of its weekly Web picks in the final
   week of  December.
