OPEN  HOUSES

Thanks to those who attended our  open houses last week at the newspaper.
Hope you found the sessions helpful. We  are currently working on a
slimmed-down version of the presentation to put on  the Source, and expect
to have that done next week. Some of you have also asked  where you can
find the entire Phil Kennicott/Travis Fox video on Azerbaijan. It is
located at

TRAFFIC FACTS

   Here were the articles on the site  that drew the most traffic in
   September:
      “Kanye  West’s Torrent of Criticism,” by Lisa de Moraes drew 559,000
      page  views.
      “’To  Me, It Just Seems Like Black People Are Marked,” by Wil
      Haygood, drew  497,000 page views.
      “Recruits  Sought for Porn Squad,” by Bart Gellman, drew 347,000 page
      views.

   The past five months have been the  site's best five months ever for
   unique visitors. Here are the Nielsen  NetRatings numbers for those
   months:
      August 2005: 8.9 million
      September 2005: 8.8 million
      June 2005: 8.5  million
      July 2005: 7.9  million
      May 2005: 7.4  million
   There were some questions at the  open houses about Live Online, and its
   traffic. Here’s a summary:

      Live Online traffic so far in  2005 has been consistently high. We've
      had our best year yet with an average  of 3.5 million page views per
      month. This year also marks the first that  this average has remained
      consistent over the summer months, when Live  Online participation
      usually drops off.
       Many long-standing regular  discussions continue to grow in
      popularity. Hosts such as Carolyn Hax and  Gene Weingarten are now
      consistently drawing 500 to 600 questions per show  (a few years ago,
      200 questions was a common high-water mark for  regulars).

WORTH A  PEEK

   is experimenting with in the U.K.: mapping  the news to allow people to
   navigate by region.
