TIPS OF THE  WEEK

Washingtonpost.com Site Index:  As discussed in  previous e-mails, we’re
working on improving our news search, but it’s not a  quick fix and it will
likely be sometime in the first quarter of 2006 before we  can launch
anything new. Until that time, remember that if you are searching for  a
specific term in a story, use quote marks around the term to improve the
quality of your search return.



Additionally, if you’re looking for  a specific subsection on the site (or
just want to see the full offering of what  we have), here is our site
index: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/contents/.



Section Front Images:  We also do provide  section-front images from the
newspaper each day, and they are available at
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/print/asectionfrontimage.html.





WORTH A  PEEK

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page:  For those who have not yet
   seen, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia created by the  public, using a tool
   called a “wiki.” A wiki is a content item that can be  edited by anyone
   and allows for products to be created  collectively. For  example,
   here’s Wikipedia’s entry on The Washington  Post.
   http://www.paidcontent.org/: Probably  the best blog centered around
   content on the Internet.
