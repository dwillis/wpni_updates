TIP OF THE  WEEK

   RSS: RSS is one of the newest and most  interesting ways of distributing
   content from multiple sources to a single  user. Essentially, you sign
   up for a feed of articles on a particular topic,  and when anything new
   is published about that topic, it is sent to you via RSS  (Real Simple
   Syndication). The only thing holding RSS back is the fact that,  right
   now, you pretty much need to download RSS reader software to get these
   feeds. But with the new My Yahoo and RSS being built into the next
   versions of  popular e-mail clients, RSS is something we’ll need to stay
   on top of. To find  out more about RSS, and see what feeds we offer,

WORTH  A PEEK

   http://annotatedtimes.blogrunner.com/:  This site was put together by a
   blog site, and the purpose is to build a  community on top of New York
   Times content. If you click around, you’ll see  they directly link to
   discussion of New York Times articles, and only  secondarily link to the
   New York Times site. Part of the reason we’re doing  comments on
   articles is to defend against anyone creating a similar site,
   leveraging Post content.
   http://www.robinsloan.com/epic/:  This has made the rounds over the past
   few months, and has gotten a lot of  buzz. It’s an eight-minute
   presentation, attempting to take a guess at where  news and information
   on the Internet is going.
