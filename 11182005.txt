TRAFFIC FACTS

   Washingtonpost.com had 8.1 million  unique visitors in October,
   according to Nielsen NetRatings. This was down  from 8.8 million in
   September, though almost all news sites showed similar  declines. For
   example, the New York Times went from 13.1 million uniques in  September
   to 11.4 in October, and CNN declined from 26 million in September to
   22.4 in October. The only exception to this trend was USA Today, which
   increased its uniques from 9.4 million to 10.4 million. The reason for
   this  surge is unknown.
   The good news in the Nielsen  NetRatings report was that time spent on
   washingtonpost.com increased by about  25 percent. In September, users
   spent an average of 17 minutes 20 seconds on  the site. In October, that
   number increased to 21 minutes 17 seconds. While we  still trail CNN and
   the New York Times significantly in this metric, we are  competitive
   with sites such as MSNBC (23:23) and far ahead of news sites such  as
   USAToday  (15:36), BBC (6:49), ABC News (10:55) and Google News
   (15:00).
   More good news: Washingtonpost.com  has had the second-largest increase
   among online newspapers in unique visitors  over the past 12 months, at
   28 percent. The biggest gainer from last year is  the Houston Chronicle,
   which had 2.6 million unique visitors in October 2005,  a 35-percent
   jump from last year.
   Microsoft launched the beta  version of live.com, and washingtonpost.com
   is one of preset news sites  available under the News category. (

TIP OF THE  WEEK

   Live Discussions/Photos &  Videos in Dropdowns: One thing you may have
   missed with the launch of the new drop-down menus across the site is
   that,  now, when you roll over Discussions or Photos & Video, we are
   showing  dynamic information and not a static list of subsections. The
   Discussions  rollover now features either the upcoming day’s highlights
   or key transcripts.  The Multimedia rollover includes key photo
   galleries or video pieces from  recent days.



 WORTH A  PEEK

   Today’s Front Pages: This  feature, from the Newseum, features a
   collection of each day’s major newspaper  front pages. Here’s a map view
   of the same  thing.
