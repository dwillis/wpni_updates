Now that we've resolved this afternoon's outage, wanted to send out the
first washingtonpost.com weekly update to the Post newsroom.



Like the site itself, we don’t want this to be a one-way street. While
we’ll use this forum to talk about what we’re doing at the site, and to
pass  along interesting links and articles, we want to hear from the folks
in the  newsroom as well. So if you have questions you’d like to see
addressed in this  email (or at the November 1 open houses discussed in an
earlier e-mail), please  drop me a line at jim.brady@washingtonpost.com.

TRAFFIC

   According to Nielsen NetRatings, washingtonpost.com had  8.9 million
   unique users in August. This is the highest number in the site’s
   history. The past four months have been the four best months in the
   site’s  history for unique visitors.
   Google has added washingtonpost.com as one of seven news sources
   available to its home page users for personalization.

 STAFF  NEWS

   Russ Walker, who previously managed the Business and Technology areas
   on the site, has now taken on Nation, Politics and World as well.
   Bob Greiner, who had been serving as the deputy business/technology
   editor, is now running business and technology’s day-to-day operation.
   Meghan Collins, who previously working the day home page  shift, has
   been named deputy editor, and will manage our 24/7 newsdesk. She  will
   replace Jim Sheppard, who is leaving to become the executive editor of
   the Toronto Globe & Mail web site.

   New York to become the national editor for AP Online. His last  day will
   be October 21.
   Tanya Ballard, our new national/investigative producer,  begins on
   October 17.
   We currently have openings for a day home page editor, a politics
   editor and a world editor.



TIP OF THE WEEK

   News Search: One of the issues raised most  frequently by our readers
   and folks in the newsroom is the difficulty of  finding articles in our
   news search. We realize that this functionality needs  major
   improvement, and as soon as we launch the new city guide later this
   month, the search  team will begin to work on an overhaul of news
   search. One tip that can help  on your search, however, is using
   quotation marks around a phrase if you are  looking for that exact
   phrase. For example, if I were to search for the term  Robin Wright and
   I did not use quotation marks, I would get every story that  mentions
   “robin” or “wright.” If you enter Robin Wright and use the quotation
   marks, you will get only items that have the phrase “robin wright” in
   it.



AWARDS

   Washingtonpost.com has won the 2005 Edward R. Murrow Award for best
   non-broadcast affiliated Web site.

WORTH A PEEK

   http://www.marumushi.com/apps/newsmap/: This  site calculates what
   articles people are accessing through Google News and  changes the size
   of the headline to reflect the popularity of the story. Kind  of like a
   visual representation of our Most E-Mailed  articles.
   http://www.chicagocrime.org: This site provides  a terrific example of
   taking publicly available data and mapping it for the  benefit of the
   reader. The site combines crime data from the Chicago Police  Department
   with Google mapping technology. The best news: We recently hired  Adrian
   Holovaty, the developer who built this application, which recently won
   a Batten Award for Innovations in Journalism.
